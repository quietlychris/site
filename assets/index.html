<p>Hello, and welcome! My name is Chris, and I'm a human who often: </p>
<div class="tab-1"><ol>- <a href="https://github.com/quietlychris">Codes things</a> (like <a href="/writing/about">this website</a>, for example, and mostly in Rust or Python)</ol></div>

<div class="tab-1"><ol>- Thinks about robots, and how they could be easier to build and use</ol></div>

<div class="tab-1"><ol>- Uses parentheticals</ol></div>

<div class="tab-1"><ol>- Drinks coffee (often from mugs with sly references to media I enjoy)</ol></div>

<p>and sometimes:</p>

<div class="tab-1"><ol>- Makes mistakes (and tries to learn from them)</ol></div>

<div class="tab-1"><ol>- Flies a drone to <a href="/writing/adventures_in_photogrammetry">measure things</a> or build <a href="/geospatial">maps</a> of things like <a href="/data#drone">kelp forests</a> or wetlands</ol></div>

<div class="tab-1"><ol>- Frolicks underwater</ol></div>

<p>and even occasionally:</p>

<div class="tab-1"><ol>- Drives long distances to see pretty things</ol></div>

    
<p>If you're also someone interested highly reliable computer systems, composable robotics autonomy, open source machine learning, or something else you think we might have in common, feel free to <a href="mailto:cmoran@cmoran.xyz">reach out</a> and say hello!</p>
