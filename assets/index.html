<p>Hello, and welcome! My name is Chris. and I'm a human who often: </p>
<div class="tab-1"><ol>- <a href="https://github.com/quietlychris">Codes things</a> (like <a href="/writing/about">this website</a>, for example, and mostly in Rust)</ol></div>

<div class="tab-1"><ol>- Thinks about robots and why they're so hard to build and use</ol></div>

<div class="tab-1"><ol>- Uses parentheticals</ol></div>

<div class="tab-1"><ol>- Drinks coffee (often from mugs with sly references to media I enjoy)</ol></div>

<p>and sometimes:</p>

<div class="tab-1"><ol>- Flies a drone to create large-scale maps of things like <a href="/data#drone">kelp forests</a></ol></div>

<div class="tab-1"><ol>- Frolicks under the water on either breath holds or SCUBA</ol></div>

<p>and even occasionally:</p>

<div class="tab-1"><ol>- Drives long distances for very little reason</ol></div>

<p> </p>

<p id="about">I most recently worked as an R&D Engineer II at UC Santa Barbara working on marine robotics and instrumentation, until I left that position in August 2021. At the moment, I'm taking some time off to rest, recharge, and learn about a few things that I haven't made time for until now, like operating systems, asynchronous programming, and robotics middlewares. That said, I'm starting to feel an itch to work on interesting challenges alongside other engineers again.</p>

<p>If you're part of a group working in areas like [highly reliable computer systems, composable robotics autonomy using something other than ROS/2, open source machine learning], please feel free to reach out. My email can be found on my <a href="/cmoran.pdf">resum√©</a>.</p>
