<p>Hello, and welcome! My name is Chris, and I'm a human who often: </p>
<div class="tab-1"><ol>- <a href="https://github.com/quietlychris">Codes things</a> (like <a href="/writing/about">this website</a>, for example, and mostly in Rust or Python)</ol></div>

<div class="tab-1"><ol>- Thinks about robots, and how they could be easier to build and use</ol></div>

<div class="tab-1"><ol>- Uses parentheticals</ol></div>

<div class="tab-1"><ol>- Drinks coffee (often from mugs with sly references to media I enjoy)</ol></div>

<p>and sometimes:</p>

<div class="tab-1"><ol>- Makes mistakes (and tries to learn from them)</ol></div>

<div class="tab-1"><ol>- Flies a drone to <a href="/writing/adventures_in_photogrammetry">measure things</a> or create large-scale maps of things like <a href="/data#drone">kelp forests</a></ol></div>

<div class="tab-1"><ol>- Frolicks underwater</ol></div>

<p>and even occasionally:</p>

<div class="tab-1"><ol>- Drives long distances to see pretty things</ol></div>

<p> </p>

<p id="about"> After taking some time off in Fall 2021 to re-evaluate things and spend some time exploring topics like asynchronous programming, operating systems, and middleware, I'm looking forward to finding new opportunities to work on interesting challenges alongside great people!</p>
    
<p>If you're part of a group working in areas like highly reliable computer systems, composable robotics autonomy, or open source machine learning (or something else equally awesome!), please feel free to take a look at my <a href="/cmoran.pdf">qualifications</a> and <a href="mailto:christopher.and.moran@gmail.com">reach out</a>!</p>
