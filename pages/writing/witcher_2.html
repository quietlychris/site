<h2 id='playing_the_witcher_2_on_linux'>Playing the Witcher 2 on Linux</h2>

<p><strong>Written 9/20/2020</strong></p>

<p>I recently hit a &quot;first&quot;: I played an actual game. I mean, in college I think I made it through the campaign of a Halo game or two with my roommates on their XBox and I think I got a couple games on CDs as a kid for Chrismas, but I&#8217;ve never been someone who I think can be fairly called a gamer.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also only owned computers running Linux for the past few years, which is supposedly not helpful for becoming a gamer. I ended up downloading Steam for Linux to do some co-play with a friend of mine on a game that we&#8217;d both played as kids, and found that it had the &quot;SteamOS&quot; marking, which indicated that it should run fairly seamlessly on Linux. My current distro is Pop!_OS, by System76, and at the moment, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s one that I&#8217;m planning on switching away from in the near future.</p>

<p>But after pulling up the Steam client one day, I a little notification on my screen that one of the deals available was CD Projekt Red&#8217;s <em>Witcher 2: Assassin of Kings</em>, for something like $4.00, <em>available for play on Linux</em>. As a result, it&#8217;s the first actual game that I&#8217;ve played through in a really long time, and definitely the first one like this I&#8217;ve played through a PC. The fact that is was on Linux was pretty cool, since I suppose I&#8217;d always considered gaming to be the domain of Windows machines alone.<br /></p>

<p>My set-up isn&#8217;t anything special in this case: I&#8217;ve got an 8-thread processor with a 4GB NVIDIA card on it, on an entry-level gaming laptop I bought about 4 years ago to do CAD work during my undergrad. I was able to upgrade the RAM this past year up to 16GB, and put a SSD into it, as I&#8217;ve been using it for some machine learning development on the side. At no point did I ever expect to be running a game on it, but to be honest, it&#8217;s worked pretty great! The game itself did experience a few &quot;unexpected crashes&quot; (I&#8217;m not exactly sure why), but most of the most of them happened at times that weren&#8217;t too terribly inconvenient, and saving somewhat often had those advantages. Maybe it&#8217;s just because I don&#8217;t know any better, but everything else seemed to run smoothly--very little stuttering during cutscenes, smooth gameplay, audio that sounded as expected. It&#8217;s almost like it was supposed to work (which, granted, I think it may have, since apparently CD Projekt Red put in a bunch of time into creating an actual Linux port, for which I&#8217;m grateful).</p>

<p>As a result, this was really my first experience with gaming, with gaming on Linux, and with basically this entire concept. It&#8217;s certainly interested, and since I&#8217;ve got more time on my hands than before with quarantine still functionally ongoing, I&#8217;m excited to dig into the whole concept a little bit more. I&#8217;ve read the Witcher books, and got a kick out of the Netflix series, so being able to play through at least one of the games as well has been a lot of fun.  In any case, I just downloaded <em>Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em>, so I guess we&#8217;ll see if that manages to work on Steam as well. Also, if you&#8217;re running Linux and looking for a fun (at least, in my humble opinion) game to play, take a look a downloading the Witcher 2, and see if that fits the bill![^1]</p>
