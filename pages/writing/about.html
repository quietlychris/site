<h2 id='about_this_website'>About this website</h2>

<p>This website is constructed as a static html site, which is being served by the Rocket framework, which is written in Rust. I like Rust, and figured this was a good excuse to learn a little bit more about its ecosystem in the web space. All the the writing that you might see here (including this page) is constructed of html code that is auto-generated from a Markdown file and given the site theme, thanks to the <code>markdown</code> crate. That&#8217;s about it! It&#8217;s not a very complicated site, only a little bit of html and css combined with a simple web server that requires less that 100 LoC. To the degree applicable, the <a href='https://github.com/quietlychris/site/'>source code</a> for this site is licensed under GPLv3, although I&#8217;m not particularly sure why someone would want the not-so-great source code of a mostly-static html site. The git repository also helps to keep track of continuity of the content, for when pieces of writing or other material get updated.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t have any contact information on here, but if you&#8217;re interested in reaching out, the easiest way to do so at the moment would be to check my GitHub commits for my contact information (link is in the menu). Otherwise, I may end up posting my CV on here at some point, which will also have that information.</p>
