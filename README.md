## website

This is the source code for my website, which is currently (albeit intermittently) hosted at [cmoran.xyz](http://cmoran.xyz). More information can be found in the "about" page, [here](./writing/about.md).

Recently, I've been playing around with some WebAssembly, which requires the [`wasm-pack`](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/) tool to be installed.
