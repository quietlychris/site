    <p>Welcome to the Sandbox!</p>
    
    <p>This is an area where I sometimes play around with new technologies or experiment with new frameworks or other technology that are new to me. As a result, links found in the the Sandbox are less likely to work well than in other areas of the site, and not everything will seem to have a meaningful purpose (largely because it probably doesn't).</p>

    <h3>toys currently in the sandbox:</h3>
