<p>Although the following might seem (and be helpful for other people), my dev log is largely notes that I've put together as I'm working through certain development issues, both to help organize my own thoughts and to help provide a reference for myself in the future.</p>

<p>19 June 2021: I had a really great day diving today, and figured that for both today, as well as in the future, maybe I'd want to write something down about it. These aren't supposed to be polished prose, but rough accounts of hopefully some nice days. </p>
