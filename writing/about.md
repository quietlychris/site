## About this website
**Updated 11/14/2021** 

Initially constructed as a static html site, I've since updated this site a fair bit. Under the hood, the site is being served by the [Rocket](https://rocket.rs) framework, which is written in Rust. I like Rust, and I figured that this was a good excuse to learn some more about its web ecosystem. All of the [writing](/writing) that you see here is served up from a series of Markdown files (which are allowed to contain a mix of Markdown and html). These files are read, converted to html using the [comrak](https://crates.io/crates/comrak) library (syntax highlighting by [syntect](https://crates.io/crates/syntect)), and formatted with the site theme before being served. When all is said and done, it's not a particularly complicated site; the main sections come in at ~100 LoC, with one or two additional functions that I experiment with. 

I also maintain a data mirror, which is composed of a few machine learning datasets (MNIST and CIFAR-10), as well as drone imagery that I've collected or processed. Feel free to use them, although I'd appreciate some consideration around not crushing them from busy CI pipelines or similar tasks. Unless otherwise specified, all content apart from the generic machine learning datasets (including both writing and imagery) is licensed under CC-BY.

There's also a section that I call the "sandbox," which I use as a place to experiment with new tech or different frameworks. Lately, that's been a combination of basic geographic information system (GIS) using the Leaflet framework (both in native Javascript and also in WebAssembly through Rust library binding), as well as dipping my toe into web frameworks like AlpineJS.

Site analytics are run using [Plausible](https://plausible.io), an open source, privacy-respecting, GDPR-compliant web analytics platform, and the site itself is hosted on a Digital Ocean droplet. I do link checking and validation using [`lychee`](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee). The [source code](https://github.com/quietlychris/site/) for this site is available on my [Github](https://github.com/quietlychris/site), and to the degree applicable, licensed under AGPLv3. The git repository also helps to keep track of continuity of the content when pieces of writing or other material get updated.
